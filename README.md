### Anime Explorer ðŸŽ¥
- main.jsx (Starting Point)
This file is where your React app starts.
It loads the main App.jsx component and places it inside the div id="root" in index.html.
It also imports global styles.
- App.jsx (Main Component & Navigation)
This is the main file that manages navigation between pages.
It includes a Navbar (so users can navigate back home).
Uses React Router to define routes:
/ â†’ Shows the home page (anime list).
/anime/:id â†’ Shows details for a specific anime.
- Home.jsx (Anime List Page)
Fetches a list of top animes from an API.
Displays the anime titles as clickable links.
Clicking on an anime takes the user to the Anime Details page.
- AnimeDetails.jsx (Anime Details Page)
Gets the anime ID from the URL.
Fetches details (title, image, description) for that specific anime.
Shows a loading message while the data is being fetched.
- api.js (API Functions)
Contains two functions to fetch data from the Jikan API:
One function gets the top anime list.
Another function gets details of a specific anime.
These functions are used in Home.jsx and AnimeDetails.jsx.
- Navbar.jsx (Top Menu)
A simple navigation bar with a Home button.
Always visible at the top for easy navigation.
- styles.css (Basic Styling)
Adds simple styles like font, text alignment, and navigation styles.
- How It Works Together:
User opens the app â†’ Home.jsx fetches and shows anime list.
User clicks an anime â†’ Goes to AnimeDetails.jsx, which fetches details.
Navbar lets user go back to home anytime.
Thatâ€™s a simple breakdown! Let me know if you need anything else.
